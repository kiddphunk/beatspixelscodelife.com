This is *Part Two* of a three-part series on visualizing poetry:

* *Part One:* What does Gertrude Stein's poetry **sound** like?
* *Part Two:* What does Gertrude Stein's poetry **look** like?
* *Part Three:* An analysis of other poems and a formal release of the VisualPoetry source code on github.

&nbsp;
Abstract
========
*In this project I investigate a method of turning poetry into music, utilizing the unmistakeable words of Gertrude Stein. Poetry becomes piano soliloquy &mdash; a beautiful mapping into the audio domain is possible, because Stein's unique linguistical algorithms created a corpus with self-similar structure.*
